**Current Compatibility Notice**

‚ö†Ô∏è **At present, this project is fully adapted and tested only for privateemail.com mailboxes. Other email providers (such as Outlook, Gmail, QQ, 163, etc.) may not work out of the box due to differences in IMAP protocol implementation and authentication methods. Developers need to test and adapt the code as needed for other providers.**

- The dedicated adaptation code for privateemail is implemented in `backend/app/services/email_service.py`, specifically in the `get_privateemail_emails` method and the automatic dispatch logic within the `get_emails` method.
- If you need to support other email providers (such as Outlook, Gmail, etc.), please add provider-specific parsing and authentication logic in the `get_emails` method based on the IMAP server address.
- Important: Outlook/Office365 has now completely disabled IMAP login with username and password. OAuth2.0 authentication is required. See the official Microsoft notice: [Deprecation of Basic authentication in Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-basic-authentication-exchange-online). If you need to adapt for Outlook, please refer to the official documentation and implement the OAuth2.0 flow.
- If you encounter compatibility issues with fetch, search, or email content parsing for other providers, please extend `email_service.py` with provider-specific methods similar to the privateemail example.

## Extending Global Settings

If you want to add new global settings (such as additional preferences, feature toggles, etc.) that should be loaded and managed across the entire application, follow these steps:

### 1. Backend: Add to .env and API
- Add your new setting to the `.env` file (e.g., `NEW_SETTING=value`).
- In `backend/app/api/settings.py`, update the `/api/settings/all` endpoint to include your new setting in the returned dictionary. For example:
  ```python
  return {
      "language": env_vars.get("LANGUAGE", "en"),
      "email_update_interval": env_vars.get("EMAIL_UPDATE_INTERVAL", 5),
      "new_setting": env_vars.get("NEW_SETTING", "default_value")
  }
  ```
- If you need to allow updating this setting from the frontend, add a corresponding API endpoint to save it to `.env`.

### 2. Frontend: Add to Global Settings
- In `frontend/src/main.ts`, add your new setting to the `globalSettings` reactive object:
  ```js
  export const globalSettings = reactive({
    language: 'en',
    emailUpdateInterval: 5,
    newSetting: 'default_value'
  })
  ```
- Update the `loadGlobalSettings` function to read the new setting from the backend response and assign it to `globalSettings`:
  ```js
  if (data.new_setting) {
    globalSettings.newSetting = data.new_setting;
  }
  ```
- Use `globalSettings.newSetting` anywhere in your Vue components to access or display the value.

### 3. Usage in Components
- Import and use `globalSettings` in any component:
  ```js
  import { globalSettings } from '../main'
  // ...
  console.log(globalSettings.newSetting)
  ```
- To update the setting and persist it, call the appropriate backend API and update `globalSettings` accordingly.

### 4. Summary
- All global settings should be loaded once at app startup and managed via the `globalSettings` object.
- This approach ensures consistency and makes it easy to add, update, or use new global settings throughout the app.
